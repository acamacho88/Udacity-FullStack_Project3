Alex Camacho - 11/8/15

This is for PROJECT 3 of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree

I have created a music database site where users can sign in through
either Facebook or Google and add artists and their albums to the site.

First, download all the files to a directoy, then run
"python database_setup.py" to create the database.

Second, run "python initializemusic.py" to start the site off with
some entries.

Third, run "python project.py" to run the website.

Users can click on artists to see existing albums, and if they are the
creator, edit, delete, and add albums to that artist's page.  Users
can also add artists to the site.

On a particular artist's page, the albums are ordered chronologically.
